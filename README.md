# About This Project
<p>This project was originally intended to be a complete rewrite of Prelude of The Chambered, however, I ended up scrapping that idea and decided to make my own dungeon crawler for the sake of it.</p>
<p>So far, the project is in a very rudimentary state which means things will be subject to change. I don't know how frequently I'll update this project but feel free to commit changes.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to message me on discord(my username is wchilla). For more information, you could check out sources.txt which is where I'll credit resources and art I've used</p>
