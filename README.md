# About This Project
<p>This project was originally intended to be a complete rewrite of Prelude of The Chambered, however, I ended up scrapping that idea and decided to make my own dungeon crawler for the sake of it.</p>
<p>So far, the project is in a very rudimentary state which means things will be subject to change. I don't know how frequently I'll update this project but feel free to commit changes.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, message me on discord. My username is wchilla. For more information, you could check out sources.txt which is where I credit resources and art I've used</p>
